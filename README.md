Dylan Hu - Work 07: Arrays and Pointers and Functions, oh my!

## Description
This program creates an array and sets all of its values to zero. It then fills it with randomly generated numbers. It prints out the average of the values in the array, which typically overflows a double.

It then creates another array, with pre-set values. It prints it out, and the array's average.

Finally, it copies the contents of the first array to the second, and prints out the new second array.

## Compilation and Usage
This project has a makefile, which you can use to just compile (`make`), run the latest compilation (`make run`), and compile and run (`make comprun`).
